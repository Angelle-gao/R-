"1","Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions.Does your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?"
"2","Hi, I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised."
"3","Hello, I can understand your concern.In my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal then no need to worry much. I hope this helps."
"4","Hi, yes, upload in this query only. I will see and revert to you."
"5","Hi, I can understand your concern. I have gone through the report you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).Your total count is on the higher side of normal along with low hemoglobin. So start Azithromycin 500 mg 1-0-0, Tablet Dolo 650 1-0-1. Once your fever and cough subside, start an Iron tablet for low hemoglobin.I hope this helps."
"6","Hi, Yes, you can take iron tablet from today onwards. And no need for Azithromycin now as you have already taken it. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation four to five times a day."
"7","Hello. Anxiety can manifest itself in physical or psychological symptoms or both. The irritation sensation you are experiencing is a part of your anxiety. Also please do not believe the hype about covid. It has a low mortality rate, of 2-3 percent, that too mortality is very high in people above 60-70 years with other co-morbidities. You do not have any such disorders and you have not even been in contact with anyone, so do not worry.Please continue to take your medicines for anxiety if you are taking them, if not, please consider visiting a psychiatrist and get started on some low dose SSRI type of medicines. Also, if needed a low dose Benzodiazepines can be added temporarily. Also, please do some deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. You can also take some honey with water to reduce the itching in the throat and also try doing some gargles with lukewarm salt water."
"8","Hello,please answer the following:Any travel history in the last one month? Any use of airports? Any fever, have you checked the temperature? Any cough? Any mucus or phlegm? How is your sleep? Is there any malaise or body aches or weakness?"
"9","Hi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or Coronavirus infection. Is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? Do you smoke or drink?"
"10","Hi, you have got it right. Follow all the precautions. You will be alright soon. Try getting a good sleep tonight.I heard about the cases in SF. My brother was supposed to fly there from India for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus.Yes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. It has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils).The tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. Once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which I guess, in you, must be slightly big. The pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection."
"11","Hello, always Protonix is better than Zantac. Try using Protonix (Pantoprazole). Do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. Do not drink a lot of water after a meal. Avoid spicy and oily foods."
"12","Hi, you need to take Pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. Avoid heavy meals. The issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. It does not appear sinister."
"13","Hi, do not worry about it. Drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. Eat well cooked meats."
"14","Hi, do not worry so much. You will be absolutely alright. Give it some time. If you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. Do you eat healthy food and do exercises?"
"15","I guess you are in the right track. With regards to food diet and exercise.Restart doing your exercise. Keep yourself active. Try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. That way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories."
"16","Hello and welcome to Ask A Doctor service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice."
"17","Depends on severity. COVID-19 pandemic at this time, so a doctor on video may consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit. Flu-like symptoms can be from a strep throat infection, a cold or influenza, or from some other cause like COVID-19. Usually, a person calls the doctor if the symptoms are bothersome, serious, recurrent, or persistent. COVID-19 testing depends on local availability."
"18","Real vs. textbook. Real-life criteria is different because we don't have enough tests, supplies, or medical staff around the world at this time (March 2020). Textbook criteria are suspected COVID in hospitalized persons or in those with underlying medical conditions; or persons who got symptoms less than 14 days after (1) contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID patient or (2) travel through high-risk COVID area."
"19","Without any details it's impossible to say."
"20","Without any details it's impossible to say."
"21","COVID-19 symptoms. Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occur fairly frequently early in the infection, but are rarely if ever the only symptoms. If cough and fever don't develop within a day or two after vomiting or diarrhea, probably it isn't COVID-19."
"22","Break. At 39 your risk for severe infections is very low. A strategy that I recommend is taking in information daily, but get away from it. Practice prudent precautions. In my off times away from ER (still practicing front line ER) I focus my mind on my cooking, planning my garden, engage with my friends and loved ones and read. "
"23","CoV229e is one of several coronaviruses that cause common colds. Biologically related to SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), but different viruses."
"24","Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms.Seek testing if sick, PLUS known Covid-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or been in facility treating people with Covid-19, or severe pneumonia of unknown cause. Call 0800 029 999 for test. If sick or possibly exposed (not both), stay home. Seek consultation if sick. If known exposure & not sick, self-isolate 14 days."
"25","your local doctor, local health department, we have no idea here what your set up is where you live."
"26","COVID infections will likely pick up over the next few weeks in US. Avoiding travel and following hand washing recommendations are probably the most important prophylactic measures."
"27","Symptoms of COVID-19 are usually the same as a cold or the flu, with diarrhea being uncommon.The COVID-19 infection is worldwide. The goal is to keep people separated so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. Patient:s with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on VIDEO or by PHONE, and get instructed to go to a clinic or ER only if not treatable by video or phone."
"28","The symptom pattern is not specific to one agent.It suggests a cold and ear infection. Kids have been among those least affected by Covid-19 . Only proper screening and testing could confirm or exclude this or any other agent. Parainfluenza, rhinovirus, or RSV would be more likely."
"29","In brief: UnlikelyNot at this point.Treat what you have currently symptomatically. Stock up now whilst not yet on lockdown. I don't feel that you qualify for a Covid test right now. Keep posting your questions."
"30","In brief: Data.From Data from China there has been association between worse infection and diarrhea.The seems to be a worse inflammatory response associated with people who have diarrhea."
"31","In brief: Respiratory illness. Cough, fever and shortness of breath are most common sx's.Per Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patient:s With 2019 Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China - JAMA, Wang et al., February 7, 2020 - about 10% of hospitalized patient had diarrhea. This study only looked at people who were so sick that they had to be hospitalized. This is a small study number."
"32","In brief: No.To date the process has been a respiratory virus.No gut issues (diarrhea,etc.) are reported so far as part of the symptom pattern."
"33","In brief: Sort of. If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it.High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission."
"34","In brief: Yes. This virus clings to everything especially hairs. Either wash your beard a few times a day and spray with alcohol or shave off."
"35","In brief: COVID-19 and Asthma.Great question. Yes asthma is a chronic lung disease which carries some increased risk with COVID-19.Good asthma control along with good handwashwng, social distancing avoiding unnecessary travel along with your young age should keep your risk of complications low. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity or compromised immune system are also risk factors to be considered."
"36","In brief: Maybe.Being over 50 with a medical condition like intermittent asthma makes you at higher risk for any respiratory illness including COVID19.It appears to be less an issue for children and youth."
"37","In brief: Not quite that way.People with chronic lung problems do worse in a lung disease outbreak..For one specific person... well, there's no way to guess. ""People"" in general do worse if they have UNcontrolled lung disease. That means it's likely that asthmatics using inhaled steroids to give them good disease control will be BETTER OFF than asthmatics who use steroids but still cannot get good control. Be in good control."
"38","In brief: No.Diarrhea does not rule out COVID.If you have traveled to endemic areas or met with people that traveled there, you should test if possible."
"39","In brief: Sort of.If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it.High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission."
"40","In brief: COVID-19 mortality.Don't confuse actual mortality rate with REPORTED rate."
"41","In brief: Hard to say.The questions you pose are more appropriate to ask your local physicians and health plans.As a USA based site we have no access to or information about the changing local recommendations for world travel around the globe nor would we know what your plan covers. Find a local health contact & contact your health plan for guidance."
"42","In brief: Standard precautions.COVID-19 is now official name for the illness caused by the newly discovered coronavirus (COronaVirus Infectious Disease - 2019).So far it is extremely rare in the US (2/12/20). Until and unless COVID-19 becomes common no special precautions are necessary. In any dormitory or group living situation people with respiratory symptoms (colds, flu, etc.) should cover their coughs and wash hands frequently."
"43","In brief: Vitamin C.While getting enough vitamin C in your diet is highly recommended, it has no special ability to prevent coronavirus or flu virus.Best preventative measures for these are frequent handwashing and avoiding people with sneezing/coughing/cold symptoms and fevers."
"44","In brief: Yes.It helps to keep the body in good shape and good nutrition."

The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease.

"172","Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health. Regards"

Get done white blood counts which will be within normal limits in case of viral and high in case of bacterial pneumonia.

"183","Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days."

"187","Lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place."

"219","Booster vaccinations. You should have had a booster at 12 years and that lasts for 10 years. If your last Tdap was at 6yrs then you are overdue. I agree with waiting for after the COVID pandemic unless you have an injury that would require tetanus immunity. Stay safe. ."
"220","In brief:   This could well be very normal.   One can get pain on day 14 during ovulation and before and during the period. Use panado for this and once we are through this corona virus you can use anti-inflammatories.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         "
"221","No. The vaccines prevent bacterial pneumonia.  They have no effect on viral pneumonia."
"222","In brief:   It may help.   Coronavirus infections may make individuals more susceptible to catching other viral or bacterial infections, esp.   if there are underlying respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD, cardiac conditions or immunocompromised states. Flu vaccines may afford a certain level of protection to kids, but they do not protect against all strains of the influenza virus.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?         "

Eating balanced diet, keeping glucose controlled, getting adequate exercise (including fresh air outdoors), & adequate sleep all should help protect you from severe consequences, but be very careful ! ."
"226","In brief:   Probably not Covid.   May be allergic, bacterial sinus infection, a different virus, a narrow upper jaw with partial airway obstruction, or other causes.

"228","In brief:   Not necessarily   You need to consult an endocrinologist for advice about diet, weight control, and medication for controlling A1c.

"229","Seek help. Contact to your doctor or go to ER for trouble to breath. If you go to ER they test you for covid 19. Your mother also can be  tested if symptomtic."
"230","Sounds risky. Using symptoms of fever, cough, or runny nose to screen for COVID-19 is not accurate because colds and flu have such symptoms. COVID testing is by nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in this pandemic. Only local resources know local testing sites, times, restrictions. Even a negative test does not guarantee one does not have COVID-19. Safest for people to stay away from ICU patients."
"231","Break. At 39 your risk for severe infections is very low. A strategy that I recommend is taking in information daily, but get away from it. Practice prudent precautions.

"239","COVID-19? It sounds like your mom is in good hands. If she has COVID, they will know how to treat it. If the pneumonia is beleived to be bacterial, they will treat with antibiotics. There is no proved effective treatment for coronavirus itself. Ask her doctors if she is a candidate for remdesivir -- not proved effective but sometimes available on a ""compassionate"" basis for severely ill patients. Good luck."

"241","It actually works. As does washing your hands with soap and water. All the germs die after using it, so they become harmless. Sanitizer and washing your hands will help protect you, but you can still catch COVID-19 through your mouth and nose and inhaled into the lungs. Social distance and quarantine as needed."
"242","In brief:   Flu vaccine   Any flu vaccine will cause your immune system to respond.  I advise,if your decision is to be vaccinated,to do it over a period of 6 weeks..I like a little bit on day 1 ,then more 2 weeks later and more two weeks later still.That way you get the full killed vaccine ,and your body develops an immune response with its ability still intact to fight Covid 19 if necessary.

Screening procedures to identify who has COVID-19 are not very reliable and vary depending on location (city, county, state, nation) and entity type (airline boarding, border control, clinic, school, etc.). Three months into the epidemic, the safest is to self-quarantine for 14-21 days upon arrival. Reliable test for virus is via nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in most places."

"308","In brief:   If you are dying   Everything is in motion and medical decisions are fluid, so you won't know until it happens.   That's because a healthy person under 50 won't die (has maybe half a percent chance of dying) from COVID-19, but a guy aged 70-80 has a 7-8% chance of dying from this... about the same as a non-elderly diabetic.

"547","In brief:   Likely nerve pain   this diagnosis would require a visit and imaging but the most likely cause is either pressure on a nerve in your neck or referred pain from the neck and shoulder with symptoms felt at the shoulder/shoulder blade.    Try to use the chlorzoxazone or an NSAID (ibuprofen or naproxen) or a combo of both and also try ice for pain, heat for stiffness or spasms.  It doesn't sound at all like COVID-19.

"550","Uncertain. The exact amount of time would depend on the inoculum or how much virus was deposited and whether the cash were dry or moist . The limited studies suggest that the virus does not live very long on cardboard - about 4 hrs or so, so I suspect paper may be similar. If it were moist or wet, it may last longer. Heat may inactivate the virus, so consider setting the money in the sun or put in a drier."
"551","In brief:   Um, no   Inhaling Lysol can be deleterious to your health, more than COVID-19 itself.   Burning your pulmonary tissues may actually make you more susceptible to getting sick from the virus. Be rational.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         "
"552","In brief:   Great Question   Not sure if you need to worry about your shoes, but it won't hurt.   In my house, we take off shoes and outside clothes at the door after we enter.

"553","Yes, but... Bacteria are living creatures, like the rest of us. Viruses are missing some parts so are not living unless they are inside another living creature. Viruses that are by themselves are dormant like seeds or spores, waiting to be reactivated. In a general sense, it is fine to think of viruses as living things, but technically speaking, they are not independently living when alone."
"554","Gargling. You can't be sure but it may help if you do those things as well as using zinc lozenges at the first sign of any throat discomfort and stay hydrated also. I recommend them. At least it'll do no harm."

"556","In brief:   Antibiotic   I don't recommend antibiotics for a simple viral upper respiratory tract infection unless examination revealed signs of acute bronchitis or sinusitis.   They are not effective for viral infections like coVid 19 with no bacterial lung involvement either. If you've been exposed to someone with coVid 19 or or if you or someone you were exposed to travelled to a region where it was endemic, get tested  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

"573","Screening test if. If you develop symptoms of dry cough, fever and/or shortness of breath, consider re testing since the test may convert to a positive test if infected. Other causes should be considered including an allergic reaction. Try one dose of an antihistamine and gauge improvement. Stay at home for three days if there is no fever. ."
"574","In brief:   Coronavirus.    Yes, according to previous knowledge, most virus including coronavirus likely will not survive hotter climates.   I would expect or hope this will die down in summer time. Nevertheless, this is new coronavirus, let's wait and see. I also think that with strong human intervention, the virus may reduce or be eliminated before summer.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?         "
"575","In brief:   Coronavirus and ACEI.   Recent publications including the one from the lancet showed COVID-19 binds to ACE-2 receptor on target cells for entrance.   The expression of ACE-2 receptor is substantially increased in patients with diabetes who were treated with ACE inhibitors or ARB. NSAIDS has the similar effect. All medications can have some unexpected side effects.    Would you like to video or text chat with me?         "
"576","In brief:   Yes   I would advise screening due to your exposure.   Fever is very commonly associated with COVID-19. Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature.

"578","Shortness of breath. Covid testing is hard to come by. At 37 you are in a lower risk group.  And I doubt you could get a test. Keep isolated for two weeks. I know we have been ordering tests through HealthTap, but that does not lead to getting the test done, due to shortages. (3/21/20)"
"579","In brief:   Basically the HPV virus is transferred within fluids generated during intercourse.   A mechanical skin contact appears to be part of the process but defining the exact amount of contact required is difficult. The genital strains of HPV are specific to those locations. There are other HPV strains that cause things like skin warts but these are different.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         "
"580","In brief:   Observatn is enough.   By looking at your child you'll know if he is having breathing difficulties.   Cough with a runny nose is common in children.
